Whatever the reason, preliminary estimates from Nielsen suggest that \"Sunday Night Football\" on NBC posted its lowest rating in nearly three years. It was not the No. 1 program of the night in total viewers or in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic. That claim goes to Game 4 of the World Series, in which the Texas Rangers defeated the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-0. That baseball game averaged 15.2 million total viewers.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/for-a-night-baseball-beats-football-in-the-ratings/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "For a Night, Baseball Beats Football in the Ratings", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1df8eb7c8105d8e919d", "document_type": "blogpost"}
