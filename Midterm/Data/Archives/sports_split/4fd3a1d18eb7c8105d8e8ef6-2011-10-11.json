Stores opened in London, then Paris and New York, and the chunky, heeled shoes all flew out the door. Then came what Cox now calls his Second Album Syndrome. \"Wannabe was so huge,\" he remembers. \"So big. So unexpected.\" What could he possibly do to top it? Though the company chugged along for a few years, Cox eventually sold it in 2007. Faced with a noncompete clause, he traveled for a bit and eventually opened a bakery called\u00a0Cox Cookies and Cake on the naughty side of Soho in London, selling baked goods that cheekily made references to the peep shows and X-rated video stores that flanked his storefront.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/brightness-rises-patrick-coxs-third-act/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Brightness Rises | Patrick Cox's Third Act", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d18eb7c8105d8e8ef6", "document_type": "blogpost"}
