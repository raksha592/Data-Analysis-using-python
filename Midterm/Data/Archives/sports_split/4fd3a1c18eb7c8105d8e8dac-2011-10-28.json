The story, written by Jeph Loeb and illustrated by Tim Sale, is set in the early days of Batman's career. Gotham City is overrun with mobsters, and the colorful freaks that make up the hero's rogues gallery are just starting to emerge. The mystery, originally told over 13 issues, centers around a murderer named Holiday, who strikes on a special day each month - whether it's Christmas, Mother's Day or Independence Day. He does not get a lot of panel time, but one of the creepiest moments comes from Calendar Man, who is housed in Arkham Asylum and does not enjoy the fact that another villain is stealing his motif of date-based crimes.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/graphic-books-best-sellers-happy-halloween/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Graphic Books Best Sellers: Happy Halloween", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1c18eb7c8105d8e8dac", "document_type": "blogpost"}
