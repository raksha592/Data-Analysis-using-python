He's been a slightly above-average hitter over his career and plays a fine outfield. He can also fill in at second or third base, although not particularly well. According to the defensive statistics compiled from video records at Fangraphs.com, Raburn's fielding has cost the Tigers 14 runs compared to an average second baseman over the 778 innings he has manned the keystone in his major league career. (He has performed even worse at third.)", "web_url": "http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/did-the-tigers-have-the-right-man-at-second-base/", "section_name": "Sports", "headline": {"main": "Did the Tigers Have the Right Man at Second Base?", "kicker": "Bats"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1698eb7c8105d8e80dc", "document_type": "blogpost"}
