(Or if he was thinking.) That's why you should check out National Geographic's October cover article by David Dobbs, \"The New Science of the Teenage Brain.\" It's full of fascinating things. Even Shakespeare is enlisted to sum up the problem of teenagedom, through a character who says, of 10- to 23-year-olds, \"There is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting.\" The bard neglects drinking, drug doing, driving while drinking or drug doing, cutting classes, indulging all sorts of cyber shenanigans, playing too much of that damn \"Halo\" video game - wait, I sound like the ancientry, don't I? - but you get the idea.
