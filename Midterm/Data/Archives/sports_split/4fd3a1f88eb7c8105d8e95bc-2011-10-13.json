Sullivan and Nemo, is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. And it's been an impressive run -- not one box-office dud among its 12 features (though some critics, including A. O. Scott of this paper, registered their disappointment with this year's sequel to \"Cars\"). The company, however, is not one to rest on its laurels. There's a full slate of Pixar films to come, including \"Brave,\" the first of its features with a female protagonist. And \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Monsters Inc.\" will return to theaters in 2012 and 2013 for limited 3-D runs.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/ask-pixars-john-lasseter-your-questions/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Ask Pixar's John Lasseter Your Questions", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1f88eb7c8105d8e95bc", "document_type": "blogpost"}
