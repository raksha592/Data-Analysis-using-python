Specifically, a cup of Blue Bottle coffee, the San Francisco-based cult favorite. Fortunately for his neighbors, Little got tired of making the trek. In August, he and his friend Chad Eggers opened Lost Weekend NYC, a lifestyle shop and coffee bar that carries, in addition to Blue Bottle, a selection of men's T-shirts, hoodies and board shorts from the clothing label Saltbox and products by the grooming gurus Malin+Goetz.
