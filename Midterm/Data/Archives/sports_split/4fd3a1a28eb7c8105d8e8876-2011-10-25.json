This is a letter George sent late last week to a well-known chef, and one he'll be sending to others. (It's worth noting, if for no other reason than to answer the inevitable question, which I asked myself, that George doesn't only sell naturally-raised meats - he sells industrially-produced stuff as well. But he's on a campaign to persuade the chefs who insist that's what they want to change their minds, and I know he'd like to supply only the right stuff.) I've changed nothing except misspellings.", "web_url": "http://bittman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/hey-chef-get-with-the-program/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "Hey Chef!
