I saw each show more than once, bought the cast albums and proceeded to play them over and over and over. \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" and \"Cowgirls\" each had a lengthy Off Broadway run but never transferred to Broadway. \"Into the Woods\" won Tony Awards when it was first produced in 1988 and when it was revived in 2002. To get a taste of each show, read about them on the Web sites Musical Heaven and The Guide to Musical Theatre and check out the clips below.", "web_url": "http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/my-three-favorite-musicals/", "section_name": "Magazine", "headline": {"main": "My Three Favorite Musicals", "kicker": "The 6th Floor"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a17d8eb7c8105d8e8479", "document_type": "blogpost"}
