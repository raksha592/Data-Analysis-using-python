Only \"CSI\" got an A, while \"Two and a Half Men\" received a cringe-worthy D. But the critic Neil Genzlinger says he actually enjoys the Ashton Kutcher version of \"Men.\" How would you grade the shifts? Then there's \"The X Factor,\" which is doing well with the 18-to-49 demographic but not with Mr. Genzlinger, who has some issues. Is there any \"reality\" in that reality competition or is Simon Cowell orchestrating everything? And what to make of the American Academy of Pediatrics warning, yet again, that parents should limit the amount of time infants and toddlers spend in front of the television screen?
