Rick Perry gets bitten by a radioactive Lincoln-Douglas debate champion and develops a sudden facility for public argument? A long-lost codicil to the Constitution is discovered, in which the Founding Fathers endorse the 9-9-9 tax plan? Utah renames itself the Republic of Deseret and secedes from the Union, forcing Romney to make a tragic choice between his religion and his country? Or, perhaps most unlikely of all - Jon Huntsman is embraced by the Tea Party and pulls off a surprise upset in Iowa?", "web_url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/romney-the-inexorable/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "Romney the Inexorable", "kicker": "Ross Douthat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1558eb7c8105d8e7df3", "document_type": "blogpost"}
