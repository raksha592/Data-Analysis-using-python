It says, \"I'm hot, but I didn't try too hard,\" and it works for almost everyone. (And for almost every designer, judging by how many copped the bare-lip look for their resort and spring shows.) It's also super-low-maintenance. \"You don't have to be concerned that your color will bleed,\" says Lisa Houghton, who did the makeup on the previous page. The only caveat: you need a well-prepped pucker. Houghton exfoliated our model's lips by dabbing on a bit of Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream and rubbing it off with a tissue.
