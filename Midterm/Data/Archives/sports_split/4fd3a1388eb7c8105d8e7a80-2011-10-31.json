But the curious knitted facade and a Day-Glo orange door turn out to be as good a sign as any as to what you can expect inside. Ramdane is a new line of clothing and accessories for men and women, a concept store with additional locations planned for Paris, Rome, London and Tokyo, and the brainchild of Ramdane Touhani, who conceived the space, designs the merchandise and, as of last week's soft opening, could be found working the sales floor of this genuinely lo-fi and coyly high-brow operation. Many of Touhami's wares, like a real Mackintosh in British Millerain cotton twill and plush V-neck sweaters in Z. Hinchliffe & Sons angora and lamb's wool boast serious Old World DNA. But details like mismatched plaid buttons, multiple offset necklines and dashes of eye-searing color keep things cheeky and cheerful - much like Touhami himself.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/serious-fun-ramdane-on-kenmare/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Serious Fun | Ramdane on Kenmare", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1388eb7c8105d8e7a80", "document_type": "blogpost"}
