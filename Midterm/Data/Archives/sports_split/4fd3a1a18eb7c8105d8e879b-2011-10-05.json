The airy, industrial space in the former Toy Building has been whitewashed and minimally outfitted, allowing the brightly colored, impossibly upbeat prints for which the 60-year-old company is famous, to shine. The founders, Armi Ratia and her husband, Viljo, always envisioned Marimekko not just as a lifestyle brand, but as a way of life, and over the years their graphic sensibility touched everything from textiles to teapots, all of which are available for purchase. There is even an on-site seamstress, to whip up, say, a set of napkins in Unikko, the signature poppy print, or a pillow cover in the artist Astrid Sylwan's brush strokey Vattenbl\u00e4nk. The folks at Marimekko hope New Yorkers will embrace the store as a meeting point; the trick, it seems, will be getting them to leave.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/prints-charming-marimekkos-new-york-city-flagship/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Prints Charming | Marimekko's New York City Flagship", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1a18eb7c8105d8e879b", "document_type": "blogpost"}
