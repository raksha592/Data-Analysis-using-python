That relationship shifts when Jung takes on and develops a close bond to a new patient, Sabina Spielrein, played by Ms. Knightley. The film's screenplay was adapted by Christopher Hampton from his stage play, \"The Talking Cure.\" The Times's Stephen Holden writes about \"A Dangerous Method\" in his notebook about films in the festival. In this video, Mr. Cronenberg discusses how he and his team used source material -- letters written by the two main subjects -- to create an accurate account of both the personal and professional lives of these men.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/david-cronenbergs-method/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "David Cronenberg's 'Method'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1468eb7c8105d8e7c65", "document_type": "blogpost"}
