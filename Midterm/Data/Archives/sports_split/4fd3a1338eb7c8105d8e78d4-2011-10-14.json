Michigan is trying to climb back to national prominence. The winner gets sole possession of first place in the Leaders Division of the Big 10. Michigan State comes in with the top defense in the nation, allowing 173.4 total yards a game and having held four of its five opponents to 7 points or fewer. Spartans linebacker Denicos Allen had two sacks against Ohio State last week. Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson, right, is electrifying but has nine interceptions. The Wolverines are outscoring opponents, 114-21, in the second half, and much of the credit goes to the defensive coordinator Greg Mattison.", "web_url": "http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/games-to-watch-on-saturday-6/", "section_name": "Sports", "headline": {"main": "Games to Watch on Saturday", "kicker": "The Quad"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1338eb7c8105d8e78d4", "document_type": "blogpost"}
