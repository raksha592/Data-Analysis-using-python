And the one that's emerged at Frieze this year is the lounge at the St. John Hotel, on Leicester Square in London's Chinatown, where the artist Sarah Lucas is in bed-sidency. Inside the Maritime bar, up one flight of blue, porthole-lined stairs from the hotel's entrance, several of Lucas's sculptures hang from the ceiling - plastic buckets and patio chairs from which stuffed pantyhose swing like Ernesto Neto-inspired breasts, conjuring the shapes of individuals who seem ready to party. Lucas herself evidently likes to stay up late; though she's spent most of the week in pajamas in Room 15, when I visited last night, around last call, she was holding court with a room packed with fair-weary revelers like Gavin Brown and MoMA P.S. 1's Peter Eleey.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/frieze-frame-sarah-lucass-bedside-manner/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Frieze Frame | Sarah Lucas's Bedside Manner", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a18f8eb7c8105d8e856d", "document_type": "blogpost"}
