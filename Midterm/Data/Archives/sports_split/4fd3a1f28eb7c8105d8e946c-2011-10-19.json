I'm spoiled because most of the shows I hear during the year are by bands that have already gotten somewhere -- even if it's only to an opening-act slot with some indie-label pals -- and are playing clubs that expect people to listen. The beauty and aggravation of CMJ is that it's a plunge into the lower echelons, the ones triaged out of my usual schedule. This is the province of peculiar club layouts, blaringly murky sound systems and disheveled guys in yesterday's T-shirt poking at their keyboard and mixer, wishing they were Erasure circa 1989. I start to wonder if the next five days are going to be like that.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/a-couple-of-good-bands-buoy-cmjs-opening-night/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "A Couple of Good Bands Buoy CMJ's Opening Night", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1f28eb7c8105d8e946c", "document_type": "blogpost"}
