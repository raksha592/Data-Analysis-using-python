Zettler alternated between the piano and acoustic guitar, leading a small band and two backup vocalists through a string of airtight pop-folk numbers. Well produced and thoroughly rehearsed, Lightyear is a solidly professional act from an accomplished songwriter who should soon be mentioned in the same breath with the likes of Meiko, Feist and Regina Spektor.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/notes-from-the-underground-lightyear/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Notes From the Underground | Lightyear", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1e48eb7c8105d8e92a6", "document_type": "blogpost"}
