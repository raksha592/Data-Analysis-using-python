The Baltimore Ravens defeated the Jets, 34-17, on \"Sunday Night Football\" to give NBC a ratings win in all viewership categories. Final audience numbers were not available on Monday afternoon. CBS finished second over all with new episodes of \"The Amazing Race\" and \"The Good Wife,\" though the numbers were skewed higher because of N.F.L. coverage overruns across the country. On ABC, \"Pan Am\" quickly lost altitude; it averaged 7.75 million total viewers in its second week, down more than 3 million from the series premiere.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/n-f-l-carries-nbc-in-sunday-night-ratings/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "N.F.L.
