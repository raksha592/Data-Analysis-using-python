Yves Smith totally misreads what I was saying in today's column, which presumably means that I didn't write it very well. When I said that it was the job of policy intellectuals to fill in the details for the Occupy Wall Street protestors, I didn't mean \"don't worry your pretty little heads about it, we'll work it out\". I meant job literally as in responsibility: people like Joe Stiglitz and me have an obligation to work on this, helping to translate what justifiably angry citizens are saying into more fleshed-out proposals. That doesn't mean taking the public out of the loop; it means putting whatever expertise you have to work on the public's behalf.", "web_url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/elitist-me/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "Elitist Me?", "kicker": "Paul Krugman"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1de8eb7c8105d8e90e0", "document_type": "blogpost"}
