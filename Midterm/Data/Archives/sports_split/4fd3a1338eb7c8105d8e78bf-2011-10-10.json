It will be run by Hazelden, the Minnesota-based operator of a network of rehab centers, and be housed in a planned luxury condo development on West Broadway that Hazelden bought after the development went belly up. The Columbia University psychiatry department is a partner in the effort. Although the popular image of live-in centers for people recovering from substance abuse runs more toward campus-like complexes in bucolic settings, where fresh air and natural beauty replace the lures of drugs and alcohol, this one - intended to serve as a transition from rehab to real life - is in the midst of a heavily traveled night life zone, near bars, clubs and restaurants that would seem to pose threats to a resident's hard-won sobriety. Have you or has someone you know been in rehab or a similar situation and found the temptations of city life hard to resist? Or do you think that treatment centers need not be remote to be effective? Please share your thoughts and experiences.", "web_url": "http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/the-appraisal-sobering-up-amid-citys-lures/", "section_name": "N.Y. / Region", "headline": {"main": "The Appraisal: Sobering Up Amid City's Lures", "kicker": "City Room"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1338eb7c8105d8e78bf", "document_type": "blogpost"}
