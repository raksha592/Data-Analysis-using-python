I feel that way myself sometimes. But I urge you to at least read the first section of Wil Hylton's story about the state of bioterrorism preparedness - it's only 400 words - and I'll be surprised if you don't feel compelled to keep going.

It's about what exactly the U.S. government has been up to since the anthrax attacks in the wake of 9/11, and the shocking extent to which we have wasted precious time and billions of dollars on poorly defined policy objectives and bureaucratic logjams.
