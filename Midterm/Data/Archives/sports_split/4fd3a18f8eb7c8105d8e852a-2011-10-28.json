United judged Dwayne De Rosario correctly, while the two teams who traded him - Toronto in April, and the Red Bulls in June - badly underestimated him. De Rosario finished tied for No. 1 in M.L.S. goals with 16, almost leading a D.C. United push that fell short of the playoffs. Thirteen of those goals, along with 7 assists, came in his 17 matches with D.C. United.", "web_url": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/decision-time-for-d-c-united-and-de-rosario/", "section_name": "Sports", "headline": {"main": "Decision Time for D.C.
