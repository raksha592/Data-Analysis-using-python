While we obsess over the new in terms of what we keep in our houses - the ever-increasing speed and functionality of our Smartphones, entertainment options built into refrigerators, sophisticated devices that monitor, analyze and report on our sleep cycles, even the superior technology of the running shoes we put on before heading out the flimsy fiberboard door - we're incredibly undemanding of the houses themselves. These continue to be built the same way they have for over a century, and usually not as well. Walls and windows are thin, materials cheap, design (and I use the term loosely) not well-considered. The building process is a protracted affair, taking far too long and creating embarrassing amounts of building waste (over 50 percent of all waste produced in the United States, in fact).", "web_url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/shifting-the-suburban-paradigm/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "Shifting the Suburban Paradigm", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1628eb7c8105d8e8014", "document_type": "blogpost"}
