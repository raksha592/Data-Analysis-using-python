O. Scott looks back at Robert Bresson's 1966 drama \"Au Hasard Balthazar,\" which tells the story of a donkey in rural France and the girl who loves him. Mr. Scott points out that the film isn't a fairy tale about an animal with human qualities, but rather \"an unsettling and tragic examination of some of the deepest mysteries of existence.\" Balthazar is the name of the donkey who is adopted by a family and befriended by Marie (Anne Wiazemsky).", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/critics-picks-video-au-hasard-balthazar/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Critics' Picks Video: 'Au Hasard Balthazar'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1388eb7c8105d8e7ace", "document_type": "blogpost"}
