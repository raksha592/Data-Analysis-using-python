The comedy could only muster 3.3 million total viewers on Wednesday. No replacement has been announced to occupy its 8:30 timeslot. Elsewhere, \"The X Factor\" transitioned nicely to the \"Boot Camp\" portion of its competition, roping in 11.5 million total viewers and winning the night for Fox in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic by retaining 100 percent of that demographic when compared to the 90-minute episode that aired last Thursday. CBS was once again the most-watched network with \"Criminal Minds\" (13.3 million viewers) leading the way.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/viewers-not-scared-to-watch-american-horror-story/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Viewers Not Scared to Watch 'American Horror Story'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1608eb7c8105d8e7f70", "document_type": "blogpost"}
