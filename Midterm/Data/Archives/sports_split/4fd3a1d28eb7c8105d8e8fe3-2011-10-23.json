That total, easily enough for No. 1, prompted Paramount Pictures, the studio behind this wildly successful horror franchise, to shriek with delight, or at least superlatives. (According to Paramount, the opening weekend total for \"Paranormal Activity 3,\" which cost just $5 million to make, is the biggest in history for a horror film -- not accounting for inflation.) The studio partly attributed strong sales to strikingly positive reviews, which helped draw more moviegoers in their 30s and 40s.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/paranormal-activity-3-has-record-opening-weekend/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "'Paranormal Activity 3' Has Record Opening Weekend", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d28eb7c8105d8e8fe3", "document_type": "blogpost"}
