He was 40, she was 17. He devoured her with his eyes, she said. Soon after, he had her family investigated, to check that her bloodlines were Aryan. He was Adolf Hitler, an amateur artist whose charisma as a reactionary orator had propelled him to the forefront of Germany's National Socialist party. She was Eva Braun, an attractive blonde from a middle-class family who, after one year at a school run by nuns, was back home living with her parents.
