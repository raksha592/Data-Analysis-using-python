Bulgogi (thin-sliced steak) and kalbi (short ribs) have a rich, succulent depth that you don't often taste at the DIY BBQ joints on 32nd Street. And the burger, although plain - not a \"bulgogi burger\" marinated with garlic, sesame, and sugar - is fantastic, served Korean-style, with rice, kimchi, and a softly fried egg to bind all together.", "web_url": "http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/reviewing-prime-beyond/", "section_name": "Style", "headline": {"main": "Reviewing Prime & Beyond", "kicker": "Diner's Journal"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1b68eb7c8105d8e8bbf", "document_type": "blogpost"}
