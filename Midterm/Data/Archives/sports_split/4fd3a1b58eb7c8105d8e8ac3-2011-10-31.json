Some wind farms are forced to dump a substantial portion of their production because they churn out megawatts in the middle of the night, when there is very little demand for it. At such times, some grid operators even charge generators for making power rather than paying them for it.", "web_url": "http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/better-batteries-not-just-for-cars-any-more/", "section_name": "Science", "headline": {"main": "Better Batteries: Not Just for Cars Anymore", "kicker": "Green"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1b58eb7c8105d8e8ac3", "document_type": "blogpost"}
