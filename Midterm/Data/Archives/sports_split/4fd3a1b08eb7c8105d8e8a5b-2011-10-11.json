There's no point quarreling with faith (in the first case) or hope (in the second). To my mind the question is whether the Tea Party will transform itself from a backlash - the Party of Against - into a force that can make things happen. The movement's best hope of making that leap any time soon, which you can view with approval or alarm, is Rick Perry.", "web_url": "http://keller.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/the-republican-scramble-continued/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "The Republican Scramble, Continued", "kicker": "Bill Keller"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1b08eb7c8105d8e8a5b", "document_type": "blogpost"}
