The New York Times was part of this, with coverage on the anti-Qaddafi forces' hasty acquisition, production and fielding of all manner of repurposed arms and the vehicles to carry them. Often these weapons were poorly used. Sometimes they were fired just as indiscriminately as the weapons fired by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's troops that NATO, in its United Nations-approved bid to protect civilians, claimed to marshal international will to stop. Some of these weapons were also instrumental in the anti-Qaddafi militias' eventual success, as was visible in Misurata. (For a fuller view of many of these themes, read this report on the hidden plant in Misurata, or these explainers on the dangerous repurposing of 57-mm air-to-ground rockets or 122-millimeter Grad rockets or, in this case, the knuckleheaded firing of plainly labeled inert rockets toward Qaddafi forces in Libya's mountainous west.)", "web_url": "http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/afghan-gun-locker-battlefield-ingenuity-and-a-weapons-longevity/", "section_name": "World", "headline": {"main": "Afghan Gun Locker: Battlefield Ingenuity, and a Weapon's Longevity", "kicker": "At War"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d08eb7c8105d8e8e33", "document_type": "blogpost"}
