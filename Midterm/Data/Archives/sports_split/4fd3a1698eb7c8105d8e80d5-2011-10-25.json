The knockout punch was delivered in Week 7. After teams averaged over 240 passing yards per game through the first six weeks of the season, the 26 teams playing in Week 7 combined for only 4,997 passing yards this past weekend, a paltry 191 yards per game. Nowhere was this more evident -- on Sunday -- than in Cleveland, as the Seahawks and Browns put on a pitiful display. The Browns and Seahawks combined for 435 yards and 9 points. It was the worst display of offense in a game not affected by severe weather in over a decade. The Colt McCoy pass attempt watch marches on: he threw 35 passes in a game in which the Browns allowed only 137 yards and 3 points.", "web_url": "http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/in-week-7-passing-defenses-continue-to-show-pop/", "section_name": "Sports", "headline": {"main": "In Week 7, Passing Defenses Continue to Show Pop", "kicker": "The Fifth Down"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1698eb7c8105d8e80d5", "document_type": "blogpost"}
