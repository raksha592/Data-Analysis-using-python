That wasn't a completely original idea. Jeffrey Schwartz, second place winner of the 2011 Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, drew them during the championship round and I thought that was a lot more fun than trying to cram the word GHOST into each square. Congratulations as well to champion Robert Mackey and third place winner Elaine Lippman.", "web_url": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/scared/", "section_name": "Crosswords/Games", "headline": {"main": "Thursday: Visibly Scared Out of One's Wits", "kicker": "Wordplay"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1e48eb7c8105d8e9204", "document_type": "blogpost"}
