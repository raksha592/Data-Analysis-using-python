The Moment recently reported on the Pink Swan Project, in which designers riffed on Arne Jacobsen's classic Swan chair. Now comes Kartell Loves Milano, an auction on Oct. 25 by Sotheby's at the Rotondo della Besana in Milan. Proceeds from the sale will benefit the Umberto Veronesi Foundation, which supports scientific research. (Its founder, for whom the foundation is named, is a surgeon and oncologist known for his innovations in cancer treatment.) For the auction, 45 individuals and groups - from the worlds of design and architecture, art, fashion, music, photography, food and even sports - will reimagine one of the Italian manufacturer Kartell's plastic furniture designs, while also paying tribute to the city of Milan, Italy's design and fashion center. While it's now become commonplace to see a fashion house like Missoni or DSquared2 reworking a chair or a mirror, it's still a novelty when the soccer club A.C. Milan or the D.J. Linus does it. An interesting design-world statistic: of the 45 participants, 29 chose to put their stamp on pieces designed by Philippe Starck - including Starck himself, who has probably done more than any other designer to make Kartell, which pioneered plastic furniture designs in the 1950s, a global brand today.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/more-do-good-design-kartell-loves-milano/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "More Do-Good Design | Kartell Loves Milano", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1338eb7c8105d8e792d", "document_type": "blogpost"}
