M. Coetzee wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the early fiction of Samuel Beckett, receiving his degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1969, the same year Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize. Thirty-four years later, Mr. Coetzee himself received the Nobel Prize for literature. Now the Harry Ransom Center, the same library where Mr. Coetzee did his research on Beckett, has acquired Mr. Coetzee's papers. Among the more than 160 boxes and filing cabinets of material are family photographs, business correspondence, recordings of interviews, notebooks and early manuscripts for his novels and his autobiography.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/university-of-texas-acquires-coetzees-papers/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "University of Texas Acquires Coetzee's Papers", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1388eb7c8105d8e7aca", "document_type": "blogpost"}
