Or so has claimed Laura Marling, a 21-year-old British sensation who is perhaps the quintessential folk singer of her generation. It's a romantic idea, this ghostly pale lass with wispy blond hair transmuting somehow - perhaps via inspiration from the Muses - her own admittedly tangled emotions into divinely inspired songs to be sung by her divinely bestowed voice. And it's an idea bolstered by the fact that her first two albums earned her a Mercury Prize nomination each. Marling's newly released third effort, \"A Creature I Don't Know,\" poetically titled like all her albums, trades some of her teenage urgency for a more muscular, acrobatic lyricism - the result being 10 tracks that feel evolved, or more grown-up even. In any case, it's clear that when Marling found this new sound, the Muses did not abandon her.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/timely-laura-marling-will-of-the-wisp/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Timely | Laura Marling, Will of the Wisp", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1af8eb7c8105d8e89a0", "document_type": "blogpost"}
