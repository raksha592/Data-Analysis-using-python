I should stipulate that I am broadly convinced by the argument that our current era of relative peace reflects a longer term trend away from violence, and broadly impressed by the evidence that Pinker marshals to support this view. (I found the book's story more persuasive than did, say, John Gray, to pick out the most hostile review I've seen to date.)
