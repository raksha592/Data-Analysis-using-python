And since vast shopping opportunities often end in devastating splurges, I arrived to test-shop the store with a plan: 10 items, $200 (which meant that the +J section on the second floor was off-limits). I started at the beginning, the bottom floor, where walls of cashmere V-neck sweaters bragged grand-opening price tags ($89.90 marked down to $49.90). So as not to throw the entirety of my allowance at four candy-colored sweaters, I jumped on the theme-park-style escalators and went straight up to the third floor. It was there that I did a double take: Japanese engineered denim for $9.90! With $190 left, I grabbed a men's flannel shirt ($29.90), a fluffy down vest ($49.90), a two-for-one Breton-striped lounge set ($24.90) and a pair of very holiday slippers ($12.90; if I don't wear them, someone in my family will come Christmastime); $72.50 to go and my winter shopping was almost done. Then I turned a corner and found myself staring into an aquarium-like tube filled with the company's famous (and effective!) Heattech pieces. I chose a knit cap ($12.90) and matching gloves ($12.90), a pack of socks ($9.90) and a camisole ($12.90). I had $23.90 left, enough for a pink umbrella ($12.90). Who knew Uniqlo sold umbrellas? Chic ones! Had I just $2 more - $11 was all that was left - I'd have bought two.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/the-uniqlo-flagship-challenge/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "The Uniqlo Flagship Challenge", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1a18eb7c8105d8e87a5", "document_type": "blogpost"}
