The bronze sculpture, covered with a white patina, was finally unveiled in Christopher Park in Greenwich Village in 1992, after years of controversy. It depicts a life-size male couple standing a few feet away from another life-size female couple sitting on a park bench. Beth Suskin, my partner of 35 years, and I, Leslie Cohen, were the models for this sculpture.
