Both the place and the date have a special significance in Smith's personal mythos and in the broader mythology of rock 'n' roll. The facility, which you enter through a nondescript storefront on a once famously scruffy block now given over to discount shoe stores and student-friendly eating places, was Jimi Hendrix's brainchild, and it stands as an enduring part of his legacy. A rack in the reception area is stocked with foldout LP sleeves of some of the legendary records that were cut here - Stevie Wonder's \"Talking Book,\" AC/DC's \"Back in Black,\" David Bowie's \"Young Americans\" - and the psychedelic murals that Hendrix commissioned line the subterranean hallways leading to Studio A. There, his portrait hangs in the lounge, a benevolent godhead gazing down at the latter-day strivings of his fellow musicians.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/requiem-lass/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Requiem Lass", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1e48eb7c8105d8e92a1", "document_type": "blogpost"}
