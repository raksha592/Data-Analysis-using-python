(He did 25 shows last season alone.) But it wasn't just the halos at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons or the bulbed ceiling that lifted from the floor at Rag & Bone that made Dreyfus such an easy and desirable pick. All over the world - at hotels in Belgrade and Athens, in galleries in Singapore and Milan, and at design fairs in London and Miami - Dreyfus's installations alter and electrify their surroundings and our experiences of them. Here, he tells T how the projected image of our signature initial happened (by accident), and the kind of light he hopes women will wear this winter.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/projected-yearnings/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Projected Yearnings", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1b58eb7c8105d8e8b4f", "document_type": "blogpost"}
