Concerning a father and son who are rival professors at a university, the movie looks at how a scholar can devote his life to a single topic of study. When he wrote about it at Telluride, A. O. Scott said the film \"blends academic satire, classic Jewish humor and an almost Shakespearean sense of the tragic potential of the paternal bond.\" \"Footnote\" is screening at the New York Film Festival this week and in this video, Mr. Cedar discusses elements of the film and some of the research he did to put it together.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/joseph-cedar-discusses-footnote/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Joseph Cedar Discusses 'Footnote'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1a28eb7c8105d8e8880", "document_type": "blogpost"}
