But an exhibition of the print versions makes perfect sense: the power of the Internet notwithstanding, it's more fun to turn real pages than digital ones.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/paper-trail/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Paper Trail", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1b58eb7c8105d8e8b50", "document_type": "blogpost"}
