What was the cafe area in the front is now the main restaurant, and though the furnishings include Swedish classics like Arne Jacobsen chairs, it is less formal than the previous dining room, which was in the back and is now for private parties. There are four- and seven-course prix-fixe menus for dinner, \u00e0 la carte or three courses at lunch. Traditional Swedish specialties like herring dishes will now be served from late afternoon through evening in the bar and lounge.", "web_url": "http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/a-new-look-for-aquavit/", "section_name": "Style", "headline": {"main": "A New Look for Aquavit", "kicker": "Diner's Journal"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1908eb7c8105d8e85de", "document_type": "blogpost"}
