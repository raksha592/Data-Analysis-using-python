So try to sound surprised when you learn that there are a couple of unexpected twists to the character that Ms. Sevigny plays in her latest project, at least one of which is strongly hinted at in its title. In \"Hit and Miss,\" a new series that will be shown on the satellite service DirecTV, she portrays a character named Mia who is a hired assassin as well as a pre-op transsexual. When Mia learns she's had a son by an ex-girlfriend who is dying of cancer, she is forced \"to mix her killer instincts with her newly acquired maternal ones\" (hey, that's what it says in the press release).", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/chloe-sevigny-has-even-more-to-hide-in-a-new-television-series/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Chlo\u00eb Sevigny Has, What Else, More Secrets in a New Television Series", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1558eb7c8105d8e7e3b", "document_type": "blogpost"}
