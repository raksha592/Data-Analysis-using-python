Of course, we've been surprised by some of the submissions. What should not have surprised us was that a recipe from a Southern city had an eye on calorie counting. We wouldn't expect that from Chicago, Green Bay or New York, where fans are pretty well bundled up for most of the season. This week's recipe is Buffalo chicken lettuce wraps, the spicy wing dish with a few of the calories lopped off. It's not too late to submit your own recipe for barbecue or chowder, or whatever makes your pregame feast tasty.", "web_url": "http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/tailgating-recipes-buffalo-chicken-wraps/", "section_name": "Sports", "headline": {"main": "Tailgating Recipes: Buffalo Chicken Wraps", "kicker": "The Fifth Down"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1b58eb7c8105d8e8b22", "document_type": "blogpost"}
