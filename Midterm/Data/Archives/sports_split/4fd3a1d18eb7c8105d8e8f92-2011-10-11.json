With McCain in the White House and a Democratic majority in Congress, Klein implies, we might have had a smaller, better-targeted stimulus package (perhaps more like the one that Alice Rivlin recommended) joined to a more robust intervention in the housing market (like the one McCain's campaign proposed in the autumn of 2008). Jonathan Chait takes this idea and uses it to make a broader argument that a McCain presidency would have forestalled the popular backlash against deficit-financed stimulus:", "web_url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/dreams-of-a-mccain-presidency/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "Dreams of a McCain Presidency", "kicker": "Ross Douthat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d18eb7c8105d8e8f92", "document_type": "blogpost"}
