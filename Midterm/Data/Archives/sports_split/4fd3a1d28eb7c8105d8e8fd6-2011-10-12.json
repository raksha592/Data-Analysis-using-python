The series, which is created by Terence Winter (a producer of \"The Sopranos\") and adapted from Nelson Johnson's book of the same title, was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards in its debut season, including nods for dramatic series and for the lead actor, Steve Buscemi, who plays the bootlegger and political powerbroker Nucky Thompson; among the eight Emmys it picked up was an award for the direction of its pilot episode, handled by Martin Scorsese, an up-and-comer we think you're going to be hearing a lot about. \"Boardwalk Empire\" is believed to be one of the costliest series that HBO has produced, with a reported budget of $18 million for its pilot episode alone.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/hbo-orders-third-season-of-boardwalk-empire/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "HBO Orders Third Season of 'Boardwalk Empire'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d28eb7c8105d8e8fd6", "document_type": "blogpost"}
