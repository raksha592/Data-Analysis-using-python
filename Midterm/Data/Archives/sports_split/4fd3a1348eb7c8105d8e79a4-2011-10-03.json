For his latest film, \"Crazy Horse,\" the director takes a look inside the workings of a landmark French strip club that has been operating since 1951. In his survey of documentaries at the New York Film Festival, A. O. Scott called the film \"a study of artistic process that is itself a work of art, and, as such, a reminder of what a documentary can be.\" Here, Mr. Wiseman discusses what interests him in the process of making documentaries and what he hopes to convey to his audience.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/frederick-wisemans-institutional-knowledge/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Frederick Wiseman's Institutional Knowledge", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1348eb7c8105d8e79a4", "document_type": "blogpost"}
