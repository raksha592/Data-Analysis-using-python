In the darkest little dive bars in Tokyo, there is evidence that he has been there. In alleyways in Los Angeles that no one ventures down and high up above the rooftops in New York, his mark winks at you familiarly - his mark being the omnipresent two word cursive tag \"Love Me\" that litters metropolitan downtowns the world over in spray paint and endless stickers. A photographer turned graffiti artist, Kulig is SoHo's most unexpected nice guy. Known as equally for his sweet demeanor as for his public cry for affection (which he's had to tone down lately), Kulig has successfully gone legit with commercial commissions like billboards for the makeup brand Bobbi Brown.
