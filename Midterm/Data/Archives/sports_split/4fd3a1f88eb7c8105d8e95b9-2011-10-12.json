How well? According to Nielsen ratings data from Sept. 19 through Oct. 9, CBS has 20 of the top 30 shows among the broadcast networks in total viewership, making CBS the first network to accomplish such a feat. It was also the number one network in average viewership and in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic. Stalwarts \"NCIS\" and \"NCIS: LA\" certainly helped the network's cause on Tuesday, garnering 18.7 million viewers and 15.4 million respectively, although the two dramas hit season lows in the 18-to-49 demo. If it can hold steady, ABC will have a new entry in the top 30 with the new Tim Allen comedy \"Last Man Standing.\" The two-episode series premiere was sampled by nearly 13 million total viewers.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/cbs-is-top-network-standing/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "CBS Is Top Network Standing", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1f88eb7c8105d8e95b9", "document_type": "blogpost"}
