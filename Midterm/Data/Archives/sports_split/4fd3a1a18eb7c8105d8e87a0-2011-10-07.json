Having satisfied his father's deepest aspirations for his son, Yanagawa moved on to his new passion: fashion design. With no schooling or training, he simply started making clothes, founding the brand John Lawrence Sullivan (named after the Irish boxer) and learning as he went. Seven years later, JLS is one of the more respected men's-wear companies in Japan and Yanagawa maintains a solid reputation as an excellent designer. Now, he is turning his sights on men's-wear for women.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/the-lowdown-arashi-yanagawa/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "The Lowdown | Arashi Yanagawa", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1a18eb7c8105d8e87a0", "document_type": "blogpost"}
