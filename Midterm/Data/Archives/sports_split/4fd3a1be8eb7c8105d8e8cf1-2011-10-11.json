But it was unclear when he might return to the stage. \"It's a wait-and-see proposition,\" Mr. Guerri said. Mr. Kwiecien felt pain during the opening scene of Monday's dress rehearsal, the manager said. He was taken by paramedics to a hospital, said the Met spokesman, Peter Clark. The Met tapped Peter Mattei, who was on hand for a production of Rossini's \"Barbiere di Siviglia,\" to replace Mr. Kwiecien for the opening of \"Don Giovanni.\" The opera has 16 more performances into March, although Mr. Kwiecien was scheduled to be in the cast only through Nov. 11.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/baritone-in-don-giovanni-taken-to-hospital/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Baritone in 'Don Giovanni' Taken to Hospital", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1be8eb7c8105d8e8cf1", "document_type": "blogpost"}
