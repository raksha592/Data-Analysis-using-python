While his younger brother gets to cut a country record (and endure endless references to his role in \"The Big Lebowski\"), the equally Dude-like Beau Bridges will soon be putting his own musical talents to use in the current Broadway revival of \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,\" its publicity representatives said on Monday. Mr. Bridges, whose credits include the films \"Norma Rae\" and \"The Fabulous Baker Boys,\" will take over the role of the corporate big shot J. B. Biggley in \"How to Succeed\" on Jan. 3 for a run that is scheduled to end on July 1. He inherits the role from John Larroquette, the \"Night Court\" and \"Boston Legal\" star who won a Tony Award for his performance in the musical earlier this year.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/beau-bridges-succeeds-john-larroquette-in-how-to-succeed-on-broadway/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Beau Bridges Succeeds John Larroquette in 'How to Succeed' on Broadway", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a16a8eb7c8105d8e8188", "document_type": "blogpost"}
