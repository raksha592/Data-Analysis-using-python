They've produced an inexpensive, wildly practical plastic chair for Vitra and directed a group of students from the ECAL in Lausanne, Switzerland, to create a playfully luxe group of objects based on a traditional Baccarat goblet. And they've been on fire - pardon the pun - since they were named in June as the designers of the 2012 Olympic torch, a sleek, triangular form with 8,000 perforated circles that represent each of the people who will carry the torches. (Yes, 8,000 torches - one for each torchbearer - will be produced.) But their latest effort is not about design in the expected sense.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/less-is-more-edward-barber-and-jay-osgerby/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Less Is More | Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1338eb7c8105d8e7926", "document_type": "blogpost"}
