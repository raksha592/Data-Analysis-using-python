(A documentary film about the program, \"Skateistan: To Live and Skate Kabul,\" had its premiere at Sundance this year.) Overcoming a lack of smooth roads and sidewalks, among other things,\u00a0Kabul's skaters - girls included - find in skating a rare recreational outlet, Abrams says. \"The mullahs have no problem with girls skating. They can't ride a bike, but they can skate. The girls just jump on it.\" Here, Abrams's diary of his weeks in Kabul, above, and a Times video on \"Skateistan,\" below.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/skating-kabul/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Skating Kabul", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1f28eb7c8105d8e940d", "document_type": "blogpost"}
