The exchange centers on Lynas's new book, \"The God Species: Saving the Planet in the Age of Humans,\"\u00a0and particularly on his conclusion that some technologies that have been anathema to environmentalists are vital to a smooth human journey in this century -- particularly nuclear power and crops developed using biotechnology. Also notable is Lynas's revised view of the \"skeptical environmentalist\" Bjorn Lomborg, whose face he once plastered with a pie. I encourage you to read it and weigh in here.", "web_url": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/mark-lynas-explains-shifts-on-biotechnology-and-nuclear-power/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "Environmentalist Explains Shifts on Biotechnology and Nuclear Power", "kicker": "Dot Earth"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1f88eb7c8105d8e94ca", "document_type": "blogpost"}
