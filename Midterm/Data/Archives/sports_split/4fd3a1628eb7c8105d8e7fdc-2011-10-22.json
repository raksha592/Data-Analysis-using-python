But such a fund would be backed by the credit of the euro area's remaining AAA governments, basically Germany and France -- yet at this point the euro situation has deteriorated sufficiently that taking on another commitment would undermine French credit. There's a hole in the bucket, and every attempt to fix that hole ends up being stymied because, well, there's a hole in the bucket.", "web_url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/theres-a-hole-in-the-bucket/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "There's A Hole In The Bucket", "kicker": "Paul Krugman"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1628eb7c8105d8e7fdc", "document_type": "blogpost"}
