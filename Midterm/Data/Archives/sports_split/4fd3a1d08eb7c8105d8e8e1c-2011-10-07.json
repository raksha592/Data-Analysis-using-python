One evening, the teenager showed up wearing a T-shirt that had a picture of the plastic inserts we used to put into the large holes of 45 r.p.m. records so that we could play them on our turntables. Strictly out of curiosity (and not masochism, as some of you are no doubt thinking), I asked the 15-year-old if she could tell me what the object on her T-shirt was, and thoroughly enjoyed the fact that she could not. The closest she could get, being only 15, was that the picture on her shirt was \"neat.\" To her credit, she knew that a turntable was something on which her Dad used to play records. Whatever those were.", "web_url": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/record/", "section_name": "Crosswords/Games", "headline": {"main": "Saturday: Sounds Like a Broken Record", "kicker": "Wordplay"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d08eb7c8105d8e8e1c", "document_type": "blogpost"}
