It will have a small takeout counter in the front, seats at the bar (a full bar this time), and tables for 30 in back.", "web_url": "http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/parm-the-torrisi-spinoff-opens-in-days/", "section_name": "Style", "headline": {"main": "Parm, the Torrisi Spinoff, Opens in Days", "kicker": "Diner's Journal"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a16a8eb7c8105d8e816d", "document_type": "blogpost"}
