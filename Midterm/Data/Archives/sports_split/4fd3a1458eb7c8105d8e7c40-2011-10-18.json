On that same afternoon when Confederate Gen. Thomas Jonathan Jackson won his moniker, \"Stonewall,\" he bestowed an equally flattering reputation on a Union regiment called the 14th Brooklyn, which wore red wool trousers as part of their local militia uniform modeled after the French chasseurs. The 14th Brooklyn - the only regiment in the Union Army called by a city's name rather than a state - was giving Jackson and his troops quite a time on Henry House Hill, and at some point Stonewall braced his soldiers for yet another charge by shouting \"Hold on Boys! Here come those red-legged devils again!\"", "web_url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/confessions-of-a-rookie-re-enactor/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "Confessions of a Rookie Re-Enactor", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1458eb7c8105d8e7c40", "document_type": "blogpost"}
