CBS claimed the top spot in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, though \"Two and a Half Men\" continued to fall from its lofty early-season perch to 14.9 million total viewers, down another million viewers from last week. One more drop of that size and the show will be in the same Charlie Sheen territory as last year.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/abc-and-cbs-share-ratings-spoils/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "ABC and CBS Share Ratings Spoils", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1348eb7c8105d8e79ae", "document_type": "blogpost"}
