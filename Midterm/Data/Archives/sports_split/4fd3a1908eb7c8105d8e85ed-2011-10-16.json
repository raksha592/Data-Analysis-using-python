The good news: \"Footloose,\" built around a cast of unknowns, cost only about $24 million to make. \"The Thing\" (Universal Pictures) was third with $8.7 million in ticket sales - not exactly a bloodbath given its production cost of about $38 million but a disappointment nonetheless. George Clooney's \"Ides of March\" (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was fourth, taking in about $7.5 million for a two-week total of $22.2 million. \"Dolphin Tale\" (Warner Brothers) rounded out the top five with $6.3 million in ticket sales, lifting its four-week tally to $58.7 million. For the weekend, North American theaters recorded $89 million in ticket sales, a 32 percent drop from the same weekend last year.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/footloose-a-wallflower-real-steel-still-dancing/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "'Footloose' a Wallflower; 'Real Steel' Still Dancing", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1908eb7c8105d8e85ed", "document_type": "blogpost"}
