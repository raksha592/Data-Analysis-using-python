Once a wild card, \"New Girl\" on Fox is now a mainstay thanks to a full-season pickup last week and its continued perch atop the 18-to-49-year-old demographic ratings. The comedy, which stars Zooey Deschanel, lifted Fox to another overall Tuesday night win in that category. \"NCIS,\" meanwhile, fulfilled the same role it has for the last nine seasons on CBS, gathering the largest possible audience (18.9 million total viewers) while posting respectable numbers in the 18-to-49 category. The one question mark: Sarah Michelle Gellar may have to go back to vampire-slaying: her new show \"Ringer\" on CW dropped another 33 percent in what was already a dismal 18-to-49 rating. It averaged 1.5 million viewers.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/new-girl-on-fox-keeps-drawing-viewers/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "'New Girl' on Fox Keeps Drawing Viewers", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1348eb7c8105d8e79aa", "document_type": "blogpost"}
