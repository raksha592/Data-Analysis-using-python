One of the things that I find fascinating about the Rubik's Cube is that, even though a single move changes the position of 8 cubies, you can string together a series of moves such that you can change the orientations of exactly 2 cubies (the quarks and anti-quarks we mentioned), leaving the rest of the cube completely unchanged. Even though we move an ensemble of eight different cubies at a time, we are able to precisely cancel the motion of all of the other cubies we moved, and hone in with surgical precision on the two we are interested in. Using sledgehammer moves, we are able to create a scalpel!", "web_url": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/numberplay-from-sledgehammer-to-scalpel/", "section_name": "Crosswords/Games", "headline": {"main": "Numberplay: From Sledgehammer to Scalpel", "kicker": "Wordplay"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d08eb7c8105d8e8e20", "document_type": "blogpost"}
