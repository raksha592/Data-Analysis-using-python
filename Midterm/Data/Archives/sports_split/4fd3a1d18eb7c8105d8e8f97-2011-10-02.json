In one sense, that divide is just over the facts: Some of us believe God created human beings just as they are now, others of us don't. But underneath this divide is a deeper one. Really divisive disagreements are typically not just over the facts. They are also about the best way to support our views of the facts. Call this a disagreement in epistemic principle. Our epistemic principles tell us what is rational to believe, what sources of information to trust. Thus while a few people may agree with Perry because they really think that the scientific evidence supports creationism, I suspect that for most people, scientific evidence (or its lack) has nothing to do with it. Their belief in creationism is instead a reflection of a deeply held epistemic principle: that, at least on some topics, scripture is a more reliable source of information than science.\u00a0 For others, including myself, this is never the case.", "web_url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/reasons-for-reason/", "section_name": "Opinion", "headline": {"main": "Reasons for Reason", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d18eb7c8105d8e8f97", "document_type": "blogpost"}
