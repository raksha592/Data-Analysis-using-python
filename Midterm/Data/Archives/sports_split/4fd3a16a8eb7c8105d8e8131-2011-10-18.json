The call came from a manager at the online backup-storage company to which Mr. Masada had entrusted what might well have been the world's most valuable collection of stand-up comedy video - 1,500 hours of acclaimed comics performing on the stage of Mr. Masada's groundbreaking Hollywood comedy club, The Laugh Factory. Some of the video was historic, including Rodney Dangerfield's earliest performances and stars like Dave Chapelle and Dane Cook honing their acts before hitting it big. And much of it existed only on the servers of the data storage company.", "web_url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/even-at-the-laugh-factory-losing-data-is-no-laughing-matter/", "section_name": "Business Day", "headline": {"main": "Even at the Laugh Factory, Losing Data Is No Laughing Matter", "kicker": "You're the Boss"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a16a8eb7c8105d8e8131", "document_type": "blogpost"}
