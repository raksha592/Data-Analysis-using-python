The show, which stars Dylan McDermott and Connie Britton as a struggling married couple living in a haunted Los Angeles mansion where people can't seem to stop dying, has been a hit for the cable network, drawing nearly 3.2 million viewers for its Oct. 5 debut and averaging about 2.8 million for each new installment. FX said that, through four episodes, \"American Horror Story\" was on track to become the highest-rated first season of any series it has broadcast, surpassing Mr. Murphy's plastic-surgery drama \"Nip/Tuck,\" which began in 2003. The second season of \"American Horror Story\" will run 13 episodes; no debut was immediately announced, though it will likely run in the fall, at which point we'll know whether it's more or less terrifying than Charlie Sheen's new FX series, \"Anger Management.\"", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/fx-adds-another-chapter-to-american-horror-story/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "FX Adds Another Chapter to 'American Horror Story'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a16a8eb7c8105d8e818b", "document_type": "blogpost"}
