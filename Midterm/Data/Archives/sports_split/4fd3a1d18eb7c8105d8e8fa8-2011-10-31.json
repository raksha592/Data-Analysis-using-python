Luckily, in 1896, the speed limit was raised to 14 miles per hour and cars no longer had to have someone walk ahead of them -- the red flag requirement having been eliminated in 1878. In the fall of 1896, motorists celebrated their newfound freedom by driving an \"Emancipation Run\" from London to the seaside town of Sussex. Today, a re-enactment of the event, now called the Brighton Veteran Car Run, takes place annually with a procession of pre-1905 cars driving from London to Brighton, about 60 miles away, this year from Nov. 4 to 6.", "web_url": "http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/antique-cars-on-display-and-on-the-road-in-london/", "section_name": "Travel", "headline": {"main": "Antique Cars on Display, and on the Road, in London", "kicker": "In Transit"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1d18eb7c8105d8e8fa8", "document_type": "blogpost"}
