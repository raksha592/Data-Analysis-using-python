Actually, the costumes are the sculptures. He calls them \"Soundsuits,\" because they're loud. Pitched at a decibel the eye can hear, they armor the body in dyed feathers, brilliant sequins, bugle beads and fake flowers, thatched twigs, strips of old sweaters and gaggles of pipe cleaners. They may have tall chairs or wicker baskets for heads. There's no way to know if they're male or female, or of what race or class, but they're too dazzling for anyone to care.", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/artifacts-the-stand-up-button-down-suit/", "section_name": "T:Style", "headline": {"main": "Artifacts | The Stand-Up, Button-Down Suit", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1a18eb7c8105d8e879c", "document_type": "blogpost"}
