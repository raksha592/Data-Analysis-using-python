That would fall a bit short of Joe Cahn, the self-proclaimed commissioner of tailgating. Cahn sold his cooking school in New Orleans in 1996 to tailgate at every N.F.L. stadium. Since then, he says, he has been to 800 games and traveled about 800,000 miles. So, Cahn seemed like a good source to contribute to the collection of tailgate party recipes on The Quad, the Times's college sports blog, and he obliged with Joe's Jambalaya. \"This is my favorite recipe because you can put just about anything in it,\" said Cahn, 63. \"If it walks, crawls, swims or flies, it can be thrown into jambalaya. Everything goes into one pot, so cleanup's a breeze.\" It's not too late to contribute a dish. Use this form to send us your recipes, and please include a picture of your fare and perhaps an interesting back story. We're still looking for some great barbecue. And who's serving breakfast?", "web_url": "http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/tailgating-recipes-the-commissioners-jambalaya/", "section_name": "Sports", "headline": {"main": "Tailgating Recipes: The Commissioner's Jambalaya", "kicker": "The Fifth Down"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1a18eb7c8105d8e876d", "document_type": "blogpost"}
