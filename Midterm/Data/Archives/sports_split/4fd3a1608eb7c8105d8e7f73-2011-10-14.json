That's the premise behind Irredeemable, a series written by Mark Waid and illustrated by Peter Krause. The former hero in question is the Plutonian and in his path are his former allies, the Paradigm, who try to impede his quest for mayhem. Plutonian's turn to the dark side may be bad for the people he used to protect, but it's good for Boom! Studios, which publishes the series as two collected editions hit our lists this week. On the hardcover list, at No. 7, is The Definitive Irredeemable, a deluxe reprint of the first three volumes of the series. On the softcover list, at No. 2, is volume seven, which finds the ex-hero in exile at an alien asylum.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/graphic-books-best-sellers-double-dipping/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Graphic Books Best Sellers: Double Dipping", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1608eb7c8105d8e7f73", "document_type": "blogpost"}
