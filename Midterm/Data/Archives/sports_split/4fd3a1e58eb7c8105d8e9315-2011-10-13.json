Their relationship is complex, to say the least. In her review, Manohla Dargis describes the film as \"an existential mystery, a melodramatic thriller, a medical horror film or just a polymorphous extravaganza.\" In this video, Mr. Almod\u00f3var talks about how skin factors into the narrative. He also discusses reuniting, after 21 years, with the actor Antonio Banderas for the project.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/beneath-pedro-almodovars-skin/", "section_name": "Arts", "headline": {"main": "Beneath Pedro Almod\u00f3var's 'Skin'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "slideshow_credits": null, "_id": "4fd3a1e58eb7c8105d8e9315", "document_type": "blogpost"}
